# CLI for NubesGen

This CLI is part of the [NubesGen project](https://nubesgen.com).

It automates a project configuration: on simple projects,
running `nubesgen` on the command line should be enough
to have it running on Azure with *no manual step*.

More specifically, this tool:
- scans the project to find its NubesGen configuration
- sets up the GitOps workflow
